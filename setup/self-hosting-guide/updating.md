# Updating Versions

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you choose to sponsor and use the CyberDrain hosted version, updates are performed automatically within 48 hours of release.
{% endhint %}

Update your application to the latest release using the following instructions:

### Updates

* Go to your own CIPP fork on GitHub
* Select Sync fork
* Select Update branch
* If prompted with a question asking "Do you want to Discard (X) Commits" or "Update Branch", ensure you click on "Update Branch" AND DO NOT PRESS DISCARD

Repeat the same steps for CIPP-API

If you don't see the update immediately - give the function app half an hour or so to finish updating itself.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are updating from version 6 or earlier, to a version newer than version 7, a few more steps are required. See the [release notes](https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/CIPP/releases/tag/v7.0.1) for v7.0.1 under "Self hosted frontend update instructions" for how to successfully update.
