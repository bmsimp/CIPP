# Configuring CIPP

## Introduction

This section of the documentation will walk you through the process of setting up the CyberDrain Improved Partner Portal (CIPP) to manage your clients' tenants efficiently.

CIPP is a powerful Microsoft 365 multitenant management system that will allow you to deploy standard properties across all your tenants, easily manage everything from a single portal, and keep your managed environments in the best shape.

## How will you be planning to use CIPP?

Depending on how you will deploy the software will determine where you will want to start.

* **Self Hosted Instance:** If you are planning on forking and hosting CIPP in your own Azure environment, you will want to start on the [Prerequisites](../self-hosting-guide/index.md) page.
* **Hosted Sponsor Instance:** If you are planning on sponsoring the CIPP project and having us host your instance for you, you can skip the "Self-hosting guide" and start configuration of CIPP by clicking next.
