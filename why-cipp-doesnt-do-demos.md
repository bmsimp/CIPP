# Why CIPP Doesn't Do Demos

We don’t offer demos or trials as CIPP operates as a Community-Led Growth and Product-Led Growth company. This approach allows us to keep the cost and contract terms as low as possible. Comparable products in the market can cost thousands of dollars per month or lock you into long-term contracts (one to three years), often with less functionality.&#x20;

If you’d like to see CIPP in action, you have several options:&#x20;

* Set it up yourself – CIPP is completely free to self-host, and you can follow our detailed [self-hosting-guide](setup/self-hosting-guide/ "mention") Guide. The cost to run a self-hosted version is roughly $0.10 per day.&#x20;
* Try our hosted version – Visit [cipp.app/pricing](https://cipp.app/pricing/) to get a subscription to CIPP. We only offer month-to-month subscription options. There are no long-term commitments, and you can cancel anytime. This is regarded as “Sponsorship”.&#x20;
* Watch training sessions – Our YouTube channel features public CIPP and SIP sessions where we train users on M365 and CIPP usage: [https://youtube.com/KelvinTegelaar](https://youtube.com/KelvinTegelaar)&#x20;
* Work with a ProServe partner – These partners offer assistance with setup, deployment, and other services for a fee. Find more information at [professional-onboarding-services.md](setup/resources/professional-onboarding-services.md "mention")

Additionally, you can join our active community of over 7,000 MSPs and CIPP users on Discord at [discord.gg/cyberdrain](https://discord.gg/cyberdrain). We encourage you to explore these options to see how CIPP fits your needs.
