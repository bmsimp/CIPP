# Roles

### Overview

The Roles page provides a comprehensive list of all Microsoft 365 roles such as Billing Administrator, Global Administrator, etc. It offers the ability to view members associated with each role. This capability promotes efficiency and transparency in managing role assignments.

### Details

The Roles page presents each role in a structured table, including the following details:

#### Fields

<table><thead><tr><th width="209">Field</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Display Name</td><td>The official name of the role.</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>A brief summary of the role.</td></tr><tr><td>Members</td><td>A list of members assigned to the role.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Per-Role Actions

<table><thead><tr><th width="206">Action / Feature</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>More Info</td><td>Displays the Extended Info flyout</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Considerations

While navigating the Roles page, please consider the following:

1. **Tenant Selection**: This page does not yet support the "All Tenants" overview. Please use the tenant selector to view roles specific to a selected tenant.
2. **Scope of Roles**: This page displays Microsoft 365 admin roles only. Exchange, Azure IAM, and Purview rights are outside the scope of this area.
