# Roles

### Overview

The Roles page provides a comprehensive list of all Microsoft 365 roles such as Billing Administrator, Global Administrator, etc. It offers the ability to view members associated with each role. This capability promotes efficiency and transparency in managing role assignments.

### Column Details

The properties returned are for the Graph resource type directoryRole. For more information on the properties please see the [Graph documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/directoryrole?view=graph-rest-1.0#properties). Additionally, CIPP will include a column outlining who is a member of each role.

### Table Actions

<table><thead><tr><th>Action / Feature</th><th>Description</th><th data-type="checkbox">Bulk Action Available</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>More Info</td><td>Displays the Extended Info flyout</td><td>false</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Considerations

While navigating the Roles page, please consider the following:

1. **Tenant Selection**: This page does not yet support the "All Tenants" overview. Please use the tenant selector to view roles specific to a selected tenant.
2. **Scope of Roles**: This page displays Microsoft 365 admin roles only. Exchange, Azure IAM, and Purview rights are outside the scope of this area.
