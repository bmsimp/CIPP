# Get Help

Have an error that you're unsure how to handle? Errors in most pages of CIPP will return with a `Get Help` button to the right of the text. Click the button and a new tab will open allowing you to search the documentation for additional information.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that not every Microsoft returned error will be included in the docs site. These can also have additional information available with a search of the internet/Microsoft documentation.
