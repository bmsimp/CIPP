# CA Policies

This page lists all the Conditional Access Policies on the selected tenant. This lists everything that's available in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM) portal, including the applications the CA applies to and used built-in controls.

## Actions

Under the three dots for Conditional Access policies you'll find these actions:

* Create template based on rule - Creates a CIPP template based on this rule to deploy to any other tenant.
* Enable Rule - Enables the rule
* Disable Rule - Disables the rule
* Set rule to report only - Sets the rule to report only
* Delete Rule - Deletes the rule. This cannot be undone.

## Template Creation

Creating a template includes all properties of the conditional policy templated; Inclusions and exclusions are translated and stored in CIPP for redeployment. When redeploying the template on any tenant every setting is included, such as Conditional Access Named locations, Authentication strengths, and any other setting.
