# Add App Approval Template

This page will allow you to create an approval template. Set the template name, application to deploy, and the permission set.

# Configure an app template

As a prerequisite, you must first create a permissions template. (https://docs.cipp.app/user-documentation/tenant/administration/permission-sets/add)

1. Navigate to Tenant Administration > Applications
2. Click on "Add App Approval Template"
3. Name the template, select the application that you want to deploy, then select the permission template and click on "Create template".

You can now deploy the application with the permissions template in Standards/Tenant Tools.
