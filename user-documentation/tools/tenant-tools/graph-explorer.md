# Graph Explorer

The Graph Explorer allows you to generate reports using the Graph API easily; instead of a JSON representation the Graph Explorer returns a table with exporting options.

You can run any of the 10 default reports, or enter your own URLs to generate a report. This allows you to customize the data to your liking
