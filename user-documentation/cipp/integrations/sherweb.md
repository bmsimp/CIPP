   * No service interruption for your users
2. **Scheduled License Management**

   * Perfect for seasonal staff or short-term projects
   * Automatic reversal of changes on schedule

## Setting Up the Integration

### Prerequisites

You should have **an active Sherweb partner account**, and access to the **Cumulus portal**. You'll need to enable API access and collect three pieces of information from Sherweb.

### Getting Your API Credentials

1. Go to the SherWeb Cumulus Portal and log in to your account: `https://cumulus.sherweb.com/partners/cippcumulus/security/apis`
2. Create a new application (you can name it "CIPP")
3. Copy the below three keys and store them securely (password manager, IT documentation, etc.)
   * **Client ID:** This is a unique identifier for your application within Sherweb.
   * **Subscription Key:** This key is used to access the Sherweb API.
   * **Client Secret (API Key):** This is a secret key used for authenticating your application.

## Configuration Steps

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're self-hosted, ensure that your deployed instance of CIPP is running version 7 or later, as that is required for access to this integration.
{% endhint %}

1. Navigate to **CIPP > Integrations**
2. Find and click on the **Sherweb** card
3. Enable the integration using the toggle switch
4. **Enter API Credentials** from your **Sherweb Cumulus Account** in the relevant fields.
5. **Custom Roles for License Purchase:** (Optional)
   * If required, use the autocomplete field to select [custom roles](../advanced/super-admin/custom-roles.md) allowed to purchase licenses. This allows you to specify which CIPP users with particular roles can use the purchase licenses functionality on the onboarding wizards & report pages.
6. **Save Configuration:** Ensure that you save the configuration by pressing Submit.

### Mapping Your Tenants

To connect your Microsoft 365 tenants with their Sherweb accounts, you'll need to map them together. This tells CIPP which Sherweb customer account corresponds to each tenant.

{% hint style="info" %}
Always review the matches before saving to ensure accuracy.
{% endhint %}

#### **Automated Mapping:**

1. Click "Automap SherWeb Organizations" to automatically match tenants
2. The system attempts to match based on:
   * Exact name matches between CIPP tenants and SherWeb customers
   * Similar name patterns
   * Domain information when available
3. Review the automated matches in the mapping table
4. Make any necessary manual adjustments
5. Click **Save Mappings** to finalize the mappings

#### **Manual Mapping:**

1. Select a tenant from the dropdown
2. Select the corresponding SherWeb organization
3. Click the + button to add the mapping
4. Repeat for additional tenants
5. Click **Save Mappings** to finalize
