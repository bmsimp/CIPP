# Super Admin

This is a menu option that is limited to the highest level of admins.

{% hint style="danger" %}
As of version 8.0, users only need the \`superadmin\` role in order to access these menus and take actions. The value should be`superadmin`for self-hosted clients. Needing admin in addition to superadmin is no longer valid. Using both you will see errors. CyberDrain hosted clients should select both roles for the user on [https://management.cipp.app/](https://management.cipp.app/)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that it may take some time for the role change to take effect.
{% endhint %}
