# CIPP New Interface Release Candidate 2 (rc2)

Weâ€™re excited to have you on board for the **CIPP New Interface Prerelease**! To get started, you can enable access via the [management portal](https://management.cipp.app/beta-program). If you're already using the beta version, simply re-enable access to receive the latest updates.

***

## **What You Need to Know**

### **Backups**

* Enabling prerelease switches your **live environment** to the new interface.&#x20;
* If needed, you can **roll back** to the previous version using the management portal, but this requires **restoring from a backup created prior to migration**.
* You are responsible for creating a backup **before migration**. This includes user profiles, personal settings, alerts, and other configurations.

### **Documentation**

* Full documentation for the new interface is still under development.
* Leverage Discord for guidance during this phase.

### **Exclusively for Hosted Users**

* Due to deployment requirements, the pre-release is currently available only for **hosted CIPP users**
* Self-hosted availability will be announced at a later date.

### **Feedback and Reporting**

* **Discord**: You'll be added to the [**#new-ui-beta**](https://discord.com/channels/905453405936447518/1318251404846043176) channel automatically if you're already in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/9avVA2Hs) and provided us with your Discord Username upon submission for beta.
  * **Any questions or feedback should be funneled through Discord exclusively.** All prerelease-related feedback, discussions, and questions will happen here.
* **GitHub**: Avoid creating GitHub issues unless you are an existing contributor. This keeps GitHub focused on actionable tasks for the dev team.
